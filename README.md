# MyFirstJavaApp
  As a task of my internship, this is the very first android app (using Java) I created.

## *Task 1:*
  - Create a new Android App in Java language
  - In `activity_main.xml` create a `textView` element

## *Task 2:*
  - In `activity_main.xml` create a `Button` element, give it an Id for reference
  - In `MainActivity.java` get reference to button using its Id.
  - Set an  `OnClickListener` to button, to respond to clicks
  - Inside the click listener, use a Toast to display a message when the button is clicked
